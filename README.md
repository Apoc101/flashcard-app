# Flashcard App made in React


This was made to exercise trivia and general knowledge, as well as to test my capabilities with React and APIs.

The way that it works is that it deserializes JSONs taken from the [open trivia API](https://opentdb.com/) into objects that are then displayed on divs aka cards; 
then you can click on the div to change it's bool "flipped" state from false to true and viceversa, hiding content and displaying it depending on the state it's in.

## IT DOES NOT WORK ON FIREFOX: for some reason when you flip the card it just refuses to hide the content on the otherside so it layers it all on the div and is unreadable.
